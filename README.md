Customer Churn refers to loss of customers. That is, if a customer or client stops taking the services of a company, it is said to have churn.

Churn is closely related to company performance. The more people learn about buyer behavior, the more money can be made. Analyzing the reasons why customers churn also helps in finding and fixing deficiencies in the services provided by the company.

To analyze the reasons why customers stop subscribing. I will use RFM analysis. RFM analysis is an analysis based on the behavior of existing customers to predict how new customers are likely to act in the future. The RFM model is built using three main factors: (Recency) how new customers are transacting with brands how often (Frequency) they engage with brands how much money (Monetary) they spend on brand products and services a basic CRM system can perform basic tracking of three characteristics easy-to-measure tools that contribute to RFM analysis:

Recency: This refers to the amount of time since a customer's last interaction with a brand, which can include their last purchase, and the time of that customer's last visit

Frequency: This refers to the number of times a customer makes a purchase or interacts with a brand over a certain period of time. A greater frequency indicates a higher level of customer loyalty.

Monetary: It refers to the total amount that a customer spends on buying products and services from a brand over a certain period of time.
